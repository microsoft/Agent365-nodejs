# Changelog

All notable changes to the Agent365 TypeScript SDK will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-09

### Changed
- Enable Observability by default unless explicitly disabling it through environment variable ENABLE_A365_OBSERVABILITY or ENABLE_OBSERVABILITY. 
- Merged `EnhancedAgentDetails` into `AgentDetails` to unify agent detail typing across scopes and middleware.

### Deprecated
- `EnhancedAgentDetails` is now an alias of `AgentDetails` and marked as deprecated. Existing imports continue to work without breaking changes; migrate to `AgentDetails` when convenient.

### Notes
- This release is non-breaking. A minor version bump reflects additive API changes and deprecation guidance.
