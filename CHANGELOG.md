# Changelog

All notable changes to the Agent365 TypeScript SDK will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Support for `A365_OBSERVABILITY_SCOPE_OVERRIDE` (singular) environment variable for cross-SDK compatibility with .NET SDK (PR #133 parity).
  - The singular form takes precedence when both singular and plural forms are set
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing `A365_OBSERVABILITY_SCOPES_OVERRIDE` (plural) that supports multiple whitespace-separated scopes
  - Updated documentation in `.env.example` files

### Notes
- This change maintains full backward compatibility. Existing code using `A365_OBSERVABILITY_SCOPES_OVERRIDE` continues to work without any changes.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-09

### Changed
- Remove ENABLE_A365_OBSERVABILITY or ENABLE_OBSERVABILITY. No longer need to use environment variable for recordAttributes, setTagMaybe, and addBaggage.
- Merged `EnhancedAgentDetails` into `AgentDetails` to unify agent detail typing across scopes and middleware.

### Deprecated
- `EnhancedAgentDetails` is now an alias of `AgentDetails` and marked as deprecated. Existing imports continue to work without breaking changes; migrate to `AgentDetails` when convenient.

### Notes
- This release is non-breaking. A minor version bump reflects additive API changes and deprecation guidance.
